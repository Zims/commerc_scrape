<h1>commerc_scrape</h1>
Development is ongoing.<br>
I pick even harder to scrape sites and scrape them for more data<br><br>

commerc_scrape is a personal project to use my knowledge in scraping the web. It was made using scrapy, but during development I looked at other scraping methods.<br> 
I took 2 e-commerce sites at random and chose a category to scrape.
After I created a custom spider for each site it was able to scrape trough the category and return the required data. No matter the page count. The output was csv, json or xml.<br>
Added scraping the details page of each item.
<h2>What I learned</h2>
<br> 1. Scraping basics and the tool comparison
<br> 2. Gained a deeper understanding of web site build elements an the ability to selec them using Xpath and css selectors.
<br> 3. Ability to navigate multiple pages of a site and scrape the content of each.
<br> 4. Designig the output files and structurung the data so it is easy to read/work with.
<br> 5. Exporting data to external files. In different formats
